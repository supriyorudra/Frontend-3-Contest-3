The Login, Signup, and Dashboard pages are an important part of any web application that requires user authentication. In this project, we will create a simple implementation of these pages using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and LocalStorage.

The project will consist of three pages: a Login page, a Signup page, and a Dashboard page. The Login and Signup pages will have forms that users can fill out to either log in or create a new account. The Dashboard page will display information specific to the logged-in user.

The Login page will have a form with two fields: email and password. When the user submits the form, the JavaScript code will check if the email and password are correct. If they are, the user will be redirected to the Dashboard page. If not, an error message will be displayed.

The Signup page will have a form with several fields, including fullname, email, and password. When the user submits the form, the JavaScript code will check if the fullname and email are unique and if the password meets the required criteria. If everything is valid, the user's information will be saved in LocalStorage, and the user will be redirected to the Login page.

The Dashboard page will display the user's information, such as their fullname and email. It will also have links to log out and edit the change password.

In this project, we will use HTML and CSS to create the layout and styling of the pages. JavaScript will be used to handle user input, form validation, and data storage/retrieval using LocalStorage.

Overall, this project will provide a basic implementation of user authentication using LocalStorage, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and access their personalized Dashboard page.
